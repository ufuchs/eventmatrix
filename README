First : Don't be confused by the project name.

Originally planned to use for time related events, now it becomes more and more 
a general purpose solution.

(Maybe it will be renamed at some time or another to 'frugal.collections' or so. Caused by its simplicity.)

Okay.

To keep the scope, in the 'eventmatrix-example' project you will find demo 
applications which use this bundle of classes for time related events.

The first demo is 'Freeday'. (Not completed yet. I'm working on.)

    - It will calculate your free days (off from business) during a year period.

    - So you can make plans to increase this time.

Best regards, Uli

PS: Maybe someone is in the mood to correct my misspellings. Thanks in advance!
