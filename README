First : Don't be confused by the project name.

Originally planned to use for time related events, now it becomes more and more 
a general purpose solution.

To keep the scope, in the 'eventmatrix-example' project you will find demo 
applications which use this bundle of classes for time related events.

Best regards, Uli

PS: Maybe somebody is in the mood to correct my misspellings. Thanks in advance!
